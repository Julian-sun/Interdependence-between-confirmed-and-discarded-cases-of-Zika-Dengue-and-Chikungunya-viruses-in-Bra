## General info
In this directory, we present the code to construct a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model to uncover possible correlation and causality effects between the series of discarded and confirmed cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Brazil.

The code originated from the project described in the preprint [1]. This was an interdisciplinary work aimed to apply mathematical/statistical tools to better understand the dissemination of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika virus in Brazil. 

## Compilation
We performed our statistical analysis using Python version 3.6.5.  We computer our code using Jupyter Notebook.

## Input data

To perform the study of time series analyses we collected the confirmed and discarded reported cases of each arbovirus per epidemiological week in Brazil, from 2015 to 2017.
