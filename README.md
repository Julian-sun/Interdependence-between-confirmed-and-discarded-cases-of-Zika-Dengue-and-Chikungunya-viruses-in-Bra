## General info
In this directory we present the code to construct a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model to uncover possible correlation and  causality effects between the series of discarded and confirmed cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Brazil.

The code originated from the project described in the preprint "Interdependence between confirmed and discarded cases of
dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses in Brazil: A multivariate time-series analysis, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/708743". This was an interdisciplinary work aimed to apply mathematical/statistical tool to better understand the dissemination of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika virus in Brazil.
